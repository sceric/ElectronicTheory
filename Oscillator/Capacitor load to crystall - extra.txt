Find a datasheet for your crystal and search loading capacitance value in the document. The capacitors should have twice value of loading capacitance minus stray capacitance (trace and pin capacitance). I.e. if loading capacitance is 20pF, stray capacitance per each uC pin 2.5pF, C44 and C45 on your circuit should be 20*2-2.5=37.5pF. So 33 or 39pF should work.
But... Check the uC oscillator specification: is oscillator capable to operate with such high-frequency crystal? Not all of the PICs can operate with 40MHz. Most of designs uses lower frequency crystals with PLL enabled if high internal frequency is needed.
